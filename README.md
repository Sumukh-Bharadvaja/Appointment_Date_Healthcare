# Business Case: Appointment Allocation of Doctors

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive case study on the strategic analysis of evening clinic telephone visits by patients, leveraging six months of healthcare data. The primary goal is to optimize the appointment allocation of doctors to enhance operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

## Objectives
- To determine the optimal number of physicians required for evening clinic appointments.
- To analyze patient visit patterns and identify peak times to ensure adequate physician availability.
- To draw insightful conclusions from the data to improve the overall effectiveness of the evening clinic program.

## Data
The analysis utilizes six months of healthcare data, focusing on patient telephone visits during evening clinic hours (after 17:30). The data includes information on patient visits, doctor allocations, and appointment outcomes.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Initial preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical analysis to understand the data's underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Modeling:** Application of statistical models to forecast demand and optimize physician scheduling.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Drawing actionable insights from the analysis to recommend improvements in physician allocation and appointment scheduling.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy for data processing, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization.

## Results
The study provides valuable insights into the evening clinic's operation, highlighting the importance of dynamic physician allocation to meet patient demand efficiently. Recommendations are made to improve the scheduling process, potentially enhancing patient satisfaction and clinic throughput.

## Conclusion
This case study underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. By analyzing patterns in patient telephone visits, healthcare providers can optimize their resources, improve patient care, and streamline clinic operations.
